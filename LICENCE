Licencing for this project is a little messy, as it includes code from vendors who don't make open source licensing easy...


This project includes code from the STM32 standard libraries. This is owned by ST Ltd., and I have no idea what the the licence terms are.

All the code in the directories "src", "include" and "bfgen", separable from the other components, is licenced under the GNU GPL version 2: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html .
